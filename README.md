# Determining Status for Loan Applicants ML Project
This project aims to create a model that determines the status of a loan application by using machine learning algorithms. The model analyzes various parameters and historical data to predict if an applicant is likely to repay a loan or default on it.

# Data
The dataset used for this project contains information about loan applicants such as Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Applicant_Income ,Co_applicant_Income, Loan_Amount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area,	Loan_Status.



# Approach
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are imputed. The categorical variables are encoded, and the data is split into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost are tested on the training set. The algorithm that performs the best on the validation set is selected.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The hyperparameters of the selected algorithm are optimized using techniques such as grid search or random search.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 
# Requirements
The project requires the following:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting

# Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting loan defaults. The model can help lenders make informed decisions about loan approvals and reduce the risk of default. However, it is essential to ensure that the model is fair and unbiased and does not discriminate against certain groups of applicants.
